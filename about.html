            Bloom & Balance was made to bring all the information about the menstrual cycle into one simple, easy-to-navigate website.</p>
         <p> From personal experience, I know how overwhelming it is to jump between different apps and websites, trying to make put together scattered advice.
             Things get lost, tabs pile up, and sometimes you forget where you even saw something helpful. 
             This project was made to have all the information on each phase of the menstrual cycle in one website. </p>
        <p>Bloom & Balance is my solution to that chaos.
            Instead of looking through bits of information all over the internet, everything you need to know is right here in one place.</p>
            <p> While developing this project, I learned even more about the menstrual phase and how to sync each phase with my everyday routine and diet.
             It was also a good opportunity to improve my web development and UI/UX skills. </p>
        <p> I hope that Bloom & Balance guides and educates more women on their menstrual cycles as it did for me and come back whenever they need some guidance. </p>
