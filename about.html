        <p>
          Bloom & Balance was made to bring all the information about the menstrual cycle into one simple, easy-to-navigate website.</p>
         <p> From personal experience, I know how overwhelming it is to jump between different apps and websites, putting together scattered advice. Things get lost, tabs pile up, and sometimes you forget where you even saw something helpful. </p>
        <p> Bloom & Balance is my solution to the scattered advice. Instead of looking through bits of information all over the internet, everything you need to know about your cycle is one place.</p>
            <p> While developing this project, I learned even more about my cycle and how to sync each phase with my everyday routine to have more energy, improve my health and work with whatâ€™s going on in my body. It was also a great opportunity to improve my web development and UI/UX skills. </p>
        <p> I hope that Bloom & Balance guides and educates more women on their menstrual cycle as it did for me and come back whenever they need some guidance.</p>
